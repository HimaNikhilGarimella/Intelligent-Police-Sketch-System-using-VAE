# Intelligent-Police-Sketch-System-using-VAE

# Abstract 
Sketch Generation in law enforcement involves of generating a visual representation of the suspect based on witness description as they aid to speed up investigation. The key objectives of the project are to develop an image that can be matched with the criminal database to speed up the investigation procedure, it also seeks to improve efficiency and accuracy of sketching by using interactive slider features. 	The methodology follows three phases, Train a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) model on a large facial dataset to generate realistic sketches, Utilize Facenet-512 to match the generated sketch with the dataset and filter the top n (depends on number of matches) matches using Decision tree algorithm, Implement a User Interface with sliders to change facial features to get much accurate outputs. The novelty lies in combining VAE driven sketch generator with Facenet based matching for precise identification of suspect from rough sketch. Additionally, the interactive slider interface allows for more accurate results and those outputs can be added back to dataset for more training data.
